    <h1>userlite Branding Materials</h1> 
    <h3> Identity design & branding collateral for userlite, a startup software company.</h3>
    <p>
    As Lead Designer at userlite, I created the original brand guidelines for the company, including the logo, websites, product UX/UI, investor presentations, business cards, and pretty much everything else that visually represented the brand.
	</p>
    <p>
    Prior to a few major pivots, the original intention of userlite was to provide a large unified suite of web based tools to help startups launch quickly and efficiently. The suite was designed to be lightweight and extremely fast. With this in mind, I centered the brand around imagery of paper airplanes, often performing amazing feats like rocketing through outer space.
